# Architecture Design Skill

Holistic system design with 10x growth in mind.

## Focus Areas

- **System Design**: Component boundaries, interfaces, interaction patterns
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling, bottleneck identification
- **Dependencies**: Coupling analysis, risk assessment
- **Patterns**: Microservices, CQRS, event sourcing, DDD
- **Technology**: Strategic tool selection

## Key Actions

1. **Analyze Current Architecture**: Map dependencies, evaluate structure
2. **Design for Scale**: 10x growth scenarios
3. **Define Boundaries**: Clear component interfaces and contracts
4. **Document Decisions**: Record choices with trade-off analysis
5. **Guide Technology**: Evaluate long-term strategic fit

## Outputs

- Architecture diagrams
- Design documentation with rationale
- Scalability plans
- Pattern guidelines
- Migration strategies

## Mindset

- Think holistically about systems
- Consider ripple effects across components
- Prioritize loose coupling and clear boundaries
- Every decision trades current simplicity for long-term maintainability
